This is the latest of a slew of tech companies who have been subject to regulatory overhand. RBC Capital Markets equity analyst Brad Erickson joins Catalysts to discuss why the regulatory challenges facing Big Tech companies should have little to no impact on investment strategies. Erickson explains that the Department of Justice is currently drafting a proposal for the judge in the default search case, outlining how they plan to \"remedy Google's ability to secure search status\" on smartphones. The DOJ has until December to submit this proposal, with the judge expected to rule by August 2025. However, Erickson notes that Google's planned appeal could extend the legal battle for several years. Due to this lengthy process, he believes Google's business \"isn't fundamentally about to change in sort of a seismic way,\" making the stock attractive at current levels. Addressing the broader regulatory landscape across the tech sector, Erickson states, \"Our kind of holistic view across the space, certainly for the companies we follow like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta (META) ... the businesses are so far down the road. The train has so far left the station that unwinding the technology and the intricacy and the complexity of what these companies have built to ... drive their businesses, I don't know if it's totally possible to unpack that.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Adam Kovacevich, Founder & CEO of Chamber of Progress, joins Morning Brief to discuss the growing tension within Big Tech. Kovacevich notes that Google is expanding in the cloud computing space, aiming to compete with industry leaders like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft. He explains that Google's focus on Microsoft stems from contractual terms that \"lock in customers and make it difficult for competitors to gain traction.\" However, he points out that this is \"not a new issue\" for Microsoft, nor is it the first time such concerns have been raised in the EU. \"This is a cold war that's gone hot between Google and Microsoft,\" Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance, noting that Microsoft has taken similar action against Google in the United States. He adds, \"I think one of the things you see here is Google punching back and saying 'look, Microsoft's contracts lock in cloud customers in the same way.'\" However, cloud computing does not have the same regulatory standards as other tech areas. \"This will be an interesting test of whether antitrust enforcers feel inclined to roll up their sleeves and take a closer look at the cloud computing market, which they haven't done to date,\" Kovacevich states.

Alphabet\u2019s new CFO Anat Ashkenazi emphasized cutting costs as a key priority, especially as the company continues to invest in AI. Meeks says, \u201cYou want to have a CFO spending on the right things but not spending foolishly.
